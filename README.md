# MinecraftPlugins

This repository is a group of smaller Minecraft plugins that I am developing to better my knowledge with the Spigot API and Java itself.  The plugins that are currently in the repository represent small minigame-type implementations that I have worked on.  Many of these designs can be originally attributed to [Dream](https://www.youtube.com/c/dream), a Minecraft Youtuber who himself codes various challenges; I have attempted to recreate many of these, putting my own personal spin on them to make them my own.

A list of projects, works in progress, and ideas will be listed below.  This will be updated continuously as portions get finished and current projects are tested for correctness.

- **Block Shuffle**
  * Block Shuffle is a challenge where contestants are tasked with finding a random block within the world and standing on that block.  They are given five minutes to find the block.  If they don't find it, they lose; the game continues until someone loses.
- **Minecraft Manhunt**
  * Minecraft Manhunt has taken Youtube by storm.  By running a command that indicates who is being hunted, the seekers are given a compass that points to the closest hunted person.  The hunted person has to try to defeat the Ender dragon before dying once.  If a hunted dies, they cannot respawn.  If all the hunted die before the Ender dragon is beaten, the hunters/seekers win.
- **Bedwars**
   * A classic game that uses a pre-generated map with beds on islands and players compete to destory enemy beds.  If your bed is not broken, then you will respawn if you die.  If your bed is broken, you have one life left!  The last man standing wins!
